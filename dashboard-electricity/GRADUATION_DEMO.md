# ðŸŽ“ Graduation Project Demo Guide
## VoltIQ Energy Prediction System

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features to Demonstrate:**

## 1. ðŸ’° **Money/Cost Calculations**

### **What to Show:**
- **Actual Cost Today**: Real electricity cost based on current usage
- **Predicted Cost**: Cost based on ML model prediction
- **Cost Difference**: How much you save or spend extra
- **Monthly Projection**: Long-term cost estimates

### **Demo Script:**
```
"Let me show you how our ML model predicts electricity costs:

1. First, I'll input some parameters (temperature, occupancy, etc.)
2. The model will make a prediction
3. Watch how the money calculations update in real-time
4. You'll see the actual cost vs predicted cost
5. The system shows if we're saving money or spending more"
```

## 2. ðŸ§  **Model Confidence**

### **What to Show:**
- **Model Confidence**: How sure the AI is about its prediction
- **Model Accuracy**: Overall model performance
- **Real-time Updates**: Confidence changes with each prediction

### **Demo Script:**
```
"Now let me demonstrate the model confidence:

1. The model shows 97.5% confidence in this prediction
2. This means it's very sure about the cost estimate
3. When I make different predictions, watch the confidence change
4. Higher confidence = more reliable cost estimates"
```

## ðŸš€ **Step-by-Step Demo:**

### **Step 1: Show Current State**
```
"Here's our dashboard showing:
- Actual Cost Today: $4.29
- Predicted Cost: $3.42  
- Cost Difference: +$0.87 (we're spending more than predicted)
- Model Confidence: 97.5%"
```

### **Step 2: Make a New Prediction**
```
"Now I'll make a new prediction with different parameters:
- Temperature: 30Â°C (hotter day)
- Occupancy: 8 people (more people)
- HVAC: Active
- Watch how the money calculations change..."
```

### **Step 3: Show the Updates**
```
"Look at how everything updated:
- Predicted Cost changed to $5.20
- Cost Difference is now -$0.91 (we're saving!)
- Model Confidence: 94.2%
- Monthly Projection updated to $156.00"
```
